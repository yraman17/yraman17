Hi! My name is Raghav Sriram and I am a second-year undergraduate at UC Irvine double majoring in computer science and biology. Iâ€™m driven by the intersection of computation and healthcare and am always seeking opportunities that combine these fields. Right now, Iâ€™m exploring these passions through my work as a Software Engineer Intern at Innervace, where I am developing data solutions for the startup, and as a researcher in the Lipkova Lab, where I'm using machine learning to analyze histological images of brain tissue.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring national parks and playing tennis, ping pong, or basketball. I also love to bike (let me know if you have any trail recommendations)!
